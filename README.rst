How to use and extend
-----------------------
To interact with and extend this documentation you need:

.. sidebar:: Note

   As of writing, this documentation has not been tried on Windows

1) this repository
2) a supported version of Python 3 (as of the writing, that means >= 3.5) - Python 2 is not supported
3) a virtual environment 

Set up repository
------------------
Just use git clone to clone this repository

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/sartography/SpiffyDucks.git

Set up virtual environment
--------------------------

Python now includes virtualenv in the standard library.

.. code:: bash

    cd SpiffyDucks
    python3 -m venv venv

This will setup a Python3 virtual environment.

Enable the virualenv we just created.

.. code:: bash

    my-prompt$ source ./venv/bin/activate
    (venv) my-prompt$


Install Requirements
--------------------

Now that we have the Python virtual environment set up, let's get our requirements installed.

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install spiffworkflow

This should get us all of the tools we will need to run the examples - Any of the .py files should be able to be run
in the SpiffExample main directory

.. code:: bash

    (venv) my-prompt$ python ducks.py
